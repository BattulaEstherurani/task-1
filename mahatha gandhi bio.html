  <h2 id="history">History of gandhi</h2>
  <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (ISO: Mōhanadāsa Karamacaṁda Gāṁdhī;[c] 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.[2]

    Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple in London and was called to the bar in June 1891, at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. There, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive</p>

<p>Mohandas did his early schooling at a school in Rajkot, where he studied history, geography, arithmetic, and languages. Later, he shifted to a high school situated in Rajkot. His marriage affected his education, but he re-joined school and completed his education. In 1888, he joined the Samaldas College in Bhavnagar.</p>

<p>Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.</p>
<h2 id="helping">Helping</h2>
<p>There are various people-groups and each has their own educational challenges, healthcare shortages, environmental concerns and lack of access to the resources they need to live wholesome lives. We may not share the same experience as others and may therefore not always be able to fully empathize with their struggles. But by stepping forward to help others in the ways that we can, we may find that “the best way to find yourself, is to lose yourself in the service of others.” We are often not able to explore what we have in common with other people but one thing we do share is our desire to live with access to our basic rights. One example of this is helping victims of natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes. When we do something, even a small act, that helps someone in desperate need, we create societies that move forward on the concept of selflessness and empathy.</p>
